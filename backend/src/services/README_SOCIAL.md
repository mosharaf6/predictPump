## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `users`: User profiles and statistics
- `comments`: Market comments with threading support
- `user_achievements`: Achievement records
- `user_follows`: Follow relationships
- `comment_likes`: Comment like tracking
- `user_reputation_history`: Reputation change history
- `market_predictions`: User predictions (foundation for future features)
- `user_notifications`: Notification system (foundation for future features)

### Key Indexes
- Performance indexes on wallet addresses, market IDs, and timestamps
- Composite indexes for efficient querying of social relationships

## API Endpoints

### User Management
- `GET /api/v1/social/users/:walletAddress` - Get user profile
- `POST /api/v1/social/users/:walletAddress` - Create/update profile (authenticated)
- `GET /api/v1/social/users/:walletAddress/achievements` - Get user achievements
- `GET /api/v1/social/users/:walletAddress/trades` - Get user trading history

### Social Features
- `POST /api/v1/social/users/:walletAddress/follow` - Follow/unfollow user (authenticated)
- `GET /api/v1/social/leaderboard` - Get user leaderboard

### Comments
- `GET /api/v1/social/markets/:marketId/comments` - Get market comments
- `POST /api/v1/social/markets/:marketId/comments` - Create comment (authenticated)
- `POST /api/v1/social/comments/:commentId/like` - Like/unlike comment (authenticated)

## Security Features

### Authentication
- Wallet-based authentication using Solana addresses
- Bearer token authentication for protected endpoints
- User can only modify their own profile

### Rate Limiting
- 200 requests per minute per IP address
- Prevents spam and abuse

### Input Validation
- Joi schema validation for all inputs
- Wallet address format validation
- Content length limits (comments max 1000 characters)

### Data Protection
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS protection through input sanitization
- Proper error handling without information leakage

## Integration Points

### Database Service Integration
- Automatic user statistics updates when trades occur
- Reputation points awarded for trading activity
- Achievement checking triggered by trading milestones

### Market Data Integration
- Comments tied to market IDs from the market system
- User trading history from blockchain events
- Performance metrics calculated from actual trades

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Notification System**: Push notifications for social events
2. **Social Feed**: Activity feed showing followed users' actions
3. **Market Predictions**: Formal prediction tracking and scoring
4. **NFT Achievements**: Mint achievement badges as NFTs
5. **Advanced Moderation**: Community-based content moderation
6. **Social Sharing**: Share predictions and achievements externally

### Technical Improvements
1. **Caching Layer**: Redis caching for frequently accessed data
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live social features
3. **Image Upload**: Avatar and media upload functionality
4. **Search**: User and content search capabilities
5. **Analytics**: Social engagement metrics and insights

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Service method testing with mocked database
- Input validation testing
- Error handling verification

### Integration Tests

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexing for social queries
- Connection pooling for concurrent requests
- Transaction management for data consistency

### Scalability
- Stateless service design
- Horizontal scaling support
- Efficient pagination for large datasets

### Monitoring
- Structured logging with Winston
- Error tracking and correlation IDs
- Performance metrics collection points

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection string (for future caching)

### Database Migrations
- Run `002_social_features.sql` migration to add social tables
- Ensure proper database permissions for the service user

### Dependencies
- All required npm packages included in package.json
- TypeScript compilation verified
- Jest testing framework configured

This social service implementation provides a solid foundation for community features in PredictionPump, with room for future enhancements and scaling.
