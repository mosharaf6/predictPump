# Requirements Document

## Introduction

PredictionPump is a decentralized prediction market platform that combines the viral mechanics of pump.fun with prediction markets. Users can create prediction markets for any event, buy/sell outcome tokens with bonding curve pricing, and earn rewards for accurate predictions. The platform features real-time price discovery, social engagement mechanics, and automated settlement through oracles.

Unlike traditional prediction markets with fixed odds, PredictionPump uses bonding curves to create dynamic pricing that responds to market sentiment in real-time. This creates exciting price action and viral potential as markets can "pump" when confidence builds around specific outcomes.
